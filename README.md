# APPRENTISSAGE-AGRIBALYSE
A showcase of different forms of Supervised and Unsupervised learning classifiers on the Agribalyse database.

I have compared the performance and accuracy between different classifiers and clustering methods on subsets of the original database. 

The file is in the form of a *Jupyter Notebook* and is well commented to help you understand the different parts of code.
