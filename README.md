# APPRENTISSAGE-AGRIBALYSE
A showcase of different forms of Supervised and Unsupervised learning classifiers on the Agribalyse database.
This project was made during my Licence 3 year at Sorbonne University, in collaboration with OUNI WASSIM, under the supervision of CHRISTOPHE MARSALA.

We have compared the performance and accuracy between different classifiers and clustering methods on subsets of the original database. 

The file is in the form of a *Jupyter Notebook* and is well commented to help you understand the different parts of code.
